You are Claude Code acting as **Principal Engineer** for the **QuicPair** repository.
Follow `/CLAUDE.md` and `/docs/TECH_SPEC.md` strictly.

**Mission (today)**:
1) Implement Noise IK (app-layer E2EE) in `server/noise.go` and iOS client.
2) Add TTFT meter (p50/p90) and `scripts/measure_ttft.*` that prints numbers.
3) Ensure Strict Local Mode (default ON) guards outbound connections.

Constraints:
- No external telemetry by default. No payload logging.
- Keep changes small and PR-ready with tests and docs updates.

Deliverables:
- Code diffs
- Test outputs (TTFT numbers for P2P and TURN)
- Updated docs (SECURITY_OVERVIEW/TEST_PLAN)
